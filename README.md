# BLOCAS DeFi Ecosystem

A comprehensive DeFi ecosystem built on Foundry featuring DAI wrapping, debenture shares with ownership tracking, and DAO governance.

## Overview

BLOCAS DeFi Ecosystem consists of four main smart contracts:

1. **WrappedDAI** - 1:1 DAI wrapper with deposit/withdraw functionality
2. **Debenture** - Percentage-based ownership tracking with sell blocking capabilities
3. **DAOGovernance** - Token-weighted voting system for decentralized decision making
4. **MockDAI** - Testing token for development and demonstrations

## Architecture

The system integrates multiple contracts to provide a complete decentralized finance solution:

- MockDAI provides stablecoin functionality for testing
- WrappedDAI offers 1:1 DAI wrapping capabilities
- Debenture tracks percentage ownership with share-based mechanics
- DAOGovernance enables token-weighted voting on proposals

The 1:1 wrapping mechanism simplifies conversions and maintains value parity.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Nix with flakes enabled
- Git

### Installation

Clone the repository and enter the development environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/test-blocas.git
cd test-blocas
nix develop
```

### Build and Test

```bash
# Compile all contracts
forge build

# Run all tests (44 comprehensive tests)
forge test

# Run tests with verbose output
forge test -vvv
```

### Run Demo

```bash
# Execute the complete system demonstration
forge script script/Demo.s.sol
```

- **DAO Tests**: 20 tests covering governance mechanics

### Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
forge test

# Run specific test suite
forge test --match-contract WrappedDAITest
forge test --match-contract DebentureTest

# Verbose output
forge test -vvv

# Gas reporting
forge test --gas-report
```

## Automated Testing Script

For comprehensive testing with detailed reporting:

```bash
# Make executable (first time only)
chmod +x test.sh

# Run standard tests
./test.sh

# Run with options
./test.sh -v -g    # verbose + gas reporting
./test.sh -c       # coverage analysis
./test.sh --clean --demo  # clean build + demo
./test.sh --help   # show all options
```

### Script Features

- Symbol: "wDAI"
- Decimals: 18
- Ratio: 1:1 with underlying DAI

### Debenture
- Configurable name and symbol
- Decimals: 18
- Share calculation: `shares = (amount * totalSupply) / totalUnderlyingBacked`
- Owner-controlled sell blocking

### DAO Governance
- Voting period: 7 days
- Minimum proposal threshold: 1,000 tokens
- Quorum threshold: 10,000 tokens
